Clean code is not just about making your code work—it's about making it understandable and maintainable for yourself and others who may work with it in the future.

## What is Clean Code?

> "Clean code is code that has been taken care of. Someone has taken the time to keep it simple and orderly."
> — Robert C. Martin

Clean code is characterized by:

- **Readability**: Easy to understand at a glance
- **Simplicity**: Does one thing well
- **Maintainability**: Easy to modify without breaking things
- **Testability**: Can be easily tested in isolation

## Naming Conventions

Names should be descriptive and reveal intent:

```typescript
// Bad
const d = new Date();
const arr = users.filter(u => u.a > 18);

// Good
const currentDate = new Date();
const adultUsers = users.filter(user => user.age > 18);
```

## Functions Should Do One Thing

Keep your functions focused:

```typescript
// Bad
function processUserData(user) {
  // validates user
  // saves to database
  // sends email
  // logs activity
}

// Good
function validateUser(user) { /* ... */ }
function saveUser(user) { /* ... */ }
function sendWelcomeEmail(user) { /* ... */ }
function logUserActivity(user) { /* ... */ }
```

## Comments: When and When Not

Comments should explain *why*, not *what*:

```typescript
// Bad - the code already says what it does
// Increment counter by 1
counter++;

// Good - explains the business reason
// We use 24 hours instead of 1 day to handle DST transitions
const expirationTime = hours * 24;
```

## The Boy Scout Rule

> "Leave the code cleaner than you found it."

Every time you work on a piece of code, make small improvements:

- Rename a confusing variable
- Extract a helper function
- Add a clarifying comment
- Remove dead code

## Practical Tips

1. **Use meaningful variable names** - Take the time to choose names that convey meaning
2. **Keep functions short** - If it doesn't fit on your screen, it's probably too long
3. **Avoid magic numbers** - Use named constants
4. **Handle errors explicitly** - Don't swallow exceptions
5. **Write tests** - They serve as documentation and prevent regressions

## Conclusion

Writing clean code is a skill that improves with practice. It requires discipline and attention to detail, but the payoff is enormous—both for you and your team.

Remember: code is read far more often than it is written. Invest the time to make it readable.
